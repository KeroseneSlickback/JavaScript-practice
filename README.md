# JavaScript-practice

A collection of projects created by following Colt Steele's and Stephen Grider's Javascript course on Udemy. The focus of this course is on Javascript, not HTML or CSS so accessability and styling aren't focused on. Some projects were personalized to suit my tastes, or altered due to depreciated code to ensure they worked properly on completion. 

Focus for study on these projects were to get first-hand experience with Javascript. All projects lebeled as finished work completely at time of completion. As a small note, some projects show some inconsistancies and issues when working outside of their designed parameters, but as these are for demonstration I'm fine with that. In addition, I return to the completed projects the day after to review the code and do the same occasionally to update myself on the different workings of Javascript. This is why I don't make many comments so I can constantly relearn something if I've forgotten it.
